# Uniswapv3 position management (UPM)
The goal of this project is to help users manage their uniswapv3 positions.

## Choosing a range
There are various strategies one can use to establishing a trading range for any currency pair. For instance, in an ETH-TokenA pair, if one is bullish on tokenA, the range would skew high, leaving lots of room for TokenA to grow against ETH. A more neutral strategy using descriptive statistics could use bollinger bands to establish a tranding range. Because of the large number of different strategies, this functionality will not be included in the initial scope of the first version.

## Collecting fees
There are a couple workflows that involve fee collection.
Explain in a very simple way what you'd like your project to do. It's easy to get complicated with ideas, but the real mental exercise is to dissolve an idea down into its essence. When discussing your idea with people, try to find a few concepts underpinning your idea.
Walk through a single workflow for the future user of your project. Once you have a general idea of what you'd like to do, isolate some of the actions a user will take. Write
You can have a big idea and only work on part of it for your project. You'll be surprised how quickly a "simple" idea can get complicated when you're writing software! Once you have a general idea, isolate two or three essential things a user will do. Those will be a great starting point for your project. If you achieve them quickly, you can move on to the other aspects of your idea!
Pseudocode is a great tool for this exercise When thinking through the actions your future users will take, it can help to write out the steps in plain language! Here's a basic example:
Voting Contract Example Workflow

1. Users will have to register themselves somehow on the contract

2. They have to identify which campaign their voting on

3. They'll have to submit a vote for that campaign.

4. They can't vote twice for a single campaign 

2. Upload it to Github Once you have a general sense of your project (Remember: it should be very simple and not complicated!), we'd like you to setup a Github repository for your project and submit your project idea in the repository's README.md file.
